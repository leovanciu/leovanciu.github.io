Welcome to my website!

I am a student at Harvard College concentrating jointly in Statistics and Mathematics, and I am pursuing a concurrent Master's degree in Statistics.

My research interests are primarily in statistics and data science with a focus on causal inference and Bayesian statistics and their applications to the health sciences.
